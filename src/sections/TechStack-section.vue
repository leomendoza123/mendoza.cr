        <h4>üõ†Ô∏èMy tech stack</h4>
        <p>
          Over 5 years of experience working on projects used by millions. With
          a deep passion for the details and attention for every line of code, I
          have acquired bast knowledge on the following technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Javascript, Typescript, Angular, Angular Components, RxJS, Webpack,
            Cypress, Html, SCSS, CSS, Git.
          </strong>

        <h4>üìöAreas of expertise</h4>
        <p>
          Making SPA(simple single-page applications) and PWA (progressive web
          apps) applying and bringing awareness to the web development best
          practices.
        </p>
        <h5>Architecture, performance, and scalability</h5>
        <p>
          I design carefully designed front-end architectures that are well
          thought, highly optimized, and modularized to be smoothly served to
          the end-users. Always looking to having great performance and a great
          user experience.
        </p>
        <h5>Code practices</h5>
        <p>
          My code is my passion, that is why I take great pride in building
          easy-to-read highly maintainable code with a strong emphasis on OOP
          (Object-oriented programming), componentization, and well-planned
          styling systems. All this not only contributes to the immediate goals
          of the projects but also to enable a long-lasting product life.
        </p>

        <h5>Frontend cross-platform and inclusivity</h5>
        <p>
          I have a trajectory working with applications that require web
          accessibility and internationalization. To serve every kind of user
          across the world consuming the content from every type of browser and
          device.
