          Currently leading a front-end migration project from a monolithic
          project into a microservice <strong>Angular</strong> based project.
          This project is currently consumed by
          <strong>over a million unique users every week</strong>, translated
          into <strong>12 languages</strong> including Arabic (yes right to left
          display!), <strong>accessible</strong>, architected to have
          <strong>great performance</strong>, be highly
          <strong>maintainable</strong> and <strong>scalable</strong>, and is
          100% <strong>open source</strong>. I am currently also participating
          in the implementation of a tested and
          <strong>automatized continuous integration</strong> and delivery
          process.

          <strong>3 million daily users</strong>, accessible and build to have
          great performance.

          and <strong>fully tested and automated</strong> continuous integration
          and delivery process as a member of one of the 5 technical teams, with
