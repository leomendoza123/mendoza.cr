        <p>
          Currently leading a front-end migration project from a monolithic
          Java-based front-end into a new shiny Angular project. This project is
          consumed by over a million unique users every week, translated into 12
          languages including Arabic (yes right to left display!), accessible,
          architected to have great performance, be highly maintainable and
          scalable, and 100% open source. I am currently also participating in
          the implementation of a tested and automatized continuous integration
          and delivery process.

        <p>
          Here I work with other developers, designers, tech support, and
          product owners, using a Canvan methodology.

          I did work on the migration of a web shopping cart from a monolithic
          java-based frontend into an Angular app. Consumed by over 3 million
          daily users, accessible and build to have great performance. Alongside
          a full agile scrum methodology, and fully tested and automated
          continuous integration and delivery process.

        <p>
          There I worked 100% remote as a member of one of the 5 technical
          teams, with other designers and scrum members.

        <p>
          Since 2015 I have been working on multiple web projects, from a
