# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the source code of my website [Mendoza.cr](https://mendoza.cr/)!

I have taken this project as an opportunity to try [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), play around with CSS/SVG animations, build a fully automated delivery process with [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), and use [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).

I plan to keep improving this project, using it to share some of the posts about tech I have been planning to write for a while, so I hope procrastination doesn't kill this idea! ðŸ¥´ ðŸš€

# How to run and build!

Just as any Vue project you can run:

```
npm install
npm run serve
```

To build it run

```
npm run build
```
